# 🚀 create-next-supabase-starter

A powerful CLI tool to **instantly scaffold a modern, production-ready Next.js 15 + Supabase project** with a single command! 🎉

This starter **eliminates the setup hassle** and provides a **pre-configured, production-ready environment with stable versions**, allowing you to focus **on building features** instead of boilerplate code.

🚀 **Why waste hours configuring when you can start coding in minutes?**
